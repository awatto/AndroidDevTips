Steps to get a sqlite database file from an Android app and read contents of it.

1. Make sure either the app is debuggable or the phone is rooted.

2. Use the following command via adb to back up the app data file.
   adb backup -apk -shared -all -f <path>/backup.ab
   
   or you may be able to access the app data file through (the app must be debuggable):
      adb shell
      run-as yourappPackageName
      cd /data/data/youappPackageName
      ls -all
   
3. Use abe (Android Backup Extractor) to extract the backup data
   java -jar abe.jar unpack backup.ab backup.tar ""
   
4. Once you get the database file from the app:
      sqlite3 database_file.db
      .tables
      .schema table_name
      
5. You may use your own code to extract the data from the database file once you have the table names and schema
